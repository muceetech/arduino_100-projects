2.  PWM frequency control for DC-DC buck, boost and buckboost controller
3.  PWM Dutycycle control for DC-DC buck, boost and buckboost controller
4.  Encoder change without interrupts
5.  Real time clock using RTCDS1307 , I2C LCD and Encoder for minute and hour adjustment
6.  Conneting an Arduino Uno to an Wifi module and control an LED from internet (MQTT)
7.  Project using an FS1000A 433 MHz RF Transmitter and receiver module to transmit 4 bits in parallel using timer and receive using PulseIn function in Arduino
8.  Giving input to Arduino from USB keyboard with USB host shield and displaying the characters in i2c lcd
